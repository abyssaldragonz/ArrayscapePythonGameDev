# FUNCTIONS ###################################################################################################

# Function to select a random word from the file
# Assume every line in the file is a unique choice and is in all lowercase
# @return: string - representing a random word selected from the file

    file.close()
    return random.choice(wordsList) # return a random word from the list

# Function to get the player input
# @param: guessedLetters - a list containing the characters the user has guessed already
#               this list is passed by reference, meaning any changes we make to it in the function
#               will be recorded outside this function
# @return: string - representing a valid user letter guess

# Function to display how much of the secret word that the user has guessed already
# @param: secretWord - the string containing the secret word to guess
# @param: guessedLetters - a list containing the characters the user has guessed already
# @return: string - representing the word in progress of being guessed
#               underscores represent letters that are still hidden

# @param: wrongGuesses - the number (integer) representing how many guesses the user has gotten wrong
# @return: void
