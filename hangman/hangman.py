# INITIALIZING ###################################################################################################
import random # a built-in module for random choice
import pygame

pygame.init() # initialize pygame and
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600)) # create a new display
screen.fill(0)
pygame.display.set_caption("HANGMAN")

MAX_INCORRECT_GUESSES = 6 # create a global variable containing the max number of incorrect guesses

# FUNCTIONS ###################################################################################################

# Function to select a random word from the file
# Assume every line in the file is a unique choice and is in all lowercase
# @return: string - representing a random word selected from the file
def selectWord() -> str:
    file = open("hangmanWords.txt", "r") # open the file
    fileContent = file.read() # read from the file
    wordsList = fileContent.split() # split into a list
    file.close()
    return random.choice(wordsList) # return a random word from the list

# Function to get the player input and check validity
# @param: guessedLetters - a list containing the characters the user has guessed already
#               this list is passed by reference, meaning any changes we make to it in the function
#               will be recorded outside this function
# @param: playerInput - a character containing the user input received from pygame; 
#                this parameter will be added in week 4
# @return: string - representing a valid user letter guess

            return playerInput
        # else - invalid guess
        return "" # so just return a blank character

# Function to display how much of the secret word that the user has guessed already
# @param: secretWord - the string containing the secret word to guess
# @param: guessedLetters - a list containing the characters the user has guessed already
# @return: string - representing the word in progress of being guessed
#               underscores represent letters that are still hidden

        else: # otherwise
            currentWord += "-" # add a dash

# Function to draw the hangman
# @param: wrongGuesses - the number (integer) representing how many guesses the user has gotten wrong
# @return: void
